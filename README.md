# HOM ontology

Welcome to the home for the ontology of homology and related concepts in biology, the HOM ontology. This ontology is developped in the context of the Bgee database (http://bgee.org/), and is used to provide annotations of similarity between anatomical structure (https://github.com/BgeeDB/anatomical-similarity-annotations).
